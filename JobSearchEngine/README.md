JobSearchingEngine
this progect was created with create-react-app command, hence it needs the npm run start command ( instead of the more recent npm run dev). Here I applied the old version of the redux store (without toolkits).
Responsiveness for all devices
Navbar allows navigation among pages, in links>an unexisting page, the user can see how an error page is structured (with manual navigation to home and timed back-route to home)
Log in button is not planned to work
Search: 
    when the user types and presses enter, a series of jobs-companies appear
    if the user click on the heart, the company is added to favourites in the store, the heart gets full and a modal appears, which signals that the company was added (eventually I will remove it, it was pure exercice on modals)
    if the user clicks on a filled heart, the company is removed from favourites in the store and the heart goes back to empty
Favourites:
    moving to the favourites page (through navbar or the below-the-title button), a list of the liked companies appears. The user can remove the company by clicking on the trashbin icon, a modal which asks for confirmation appears with the name of the company, if the user confirms, the company is removed from the store and the home page heart design goes back to empty
Company:
    By clicking on the link of the company, the user will be redirected on the page which shows the available positions for the selected company. The status of the heart icon is updated according to the current user's likes/dislikes
in the footer section, a pagination (not meant to function) has been inserted

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
